# TaskRemind

## Inspiration
In school, I always struggle with "what's due" and keeping track of my progress, so I wanted to create a way to simply organize what I have to do and what I've already completed.

## What it does
As it stands for this hackathon, the program very simply creates a "task box" and allows the user to move it between 3 different columns based on their progress on the task.

## How we built it
I built this program with HTML and JS to run locally on a machine.

## Challenges we ran into
Personally, I'm really not that familiar with HTML, so this was a huge undertaking, and for me, my knowledge topped out at being able to record what the user had created and log it to a json file. In theory, it should work flawlessly, but I had a lot of issues getting it to work in actuality.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
As mentioned above, I am not the most experienced in HTML, so getting all of the items to resize based on the window dynamically was a huge win for me, as well as getting the overall style of the website, which was extremely important to nail down given the nature of the hackathon.

## What we learned
I am a lot more familiar with walking around an HTML document. I also have learned a ton about scripting in js and setting properties for styling in CSS.

## What's next for TaskRemind
The most important thing for the future of TaskRemind is the logging of data in a json format. I wish this was something I had time to integrate in this project, however I ran out of capacity and time for today. The second thing I would like to add is a mechanic to set the priorities of the tasks instead of the last added being left at the top.
